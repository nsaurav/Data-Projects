Aim : Predicting Handwritten-digits using SVM with PCA and regularized logistic classifier. 

Implemented and Analyzed performance of 
           1) Regularized logistic classifier( using newtons optimization ) 
	   2) SVM with Gaussian Kernel and PCA (Principal Component Analysis )

 
Used cross validation to tune value of regularization hyperparameters.
Newtons method is used for optimization.

Tried Using various preprocessing step with PCA ( Princiapl Component Analysis )
    1) Digonalize 
    2) Whitening the Data
    3) Standardizing the Data
Used SVM with Gaussian kernel and used cross validation to tune value of hyperparameters. 

SVM gave better results.
